# Added this redirect because I used axios instead of api (default export of axios.config.ts) to make request 
# to the api endpoints (attendee endpoints) on my server. I could have added /api/v1 in front of my endpoints 
# on my frontend too but then that would have required me to also make changes in my vite.config.ts so that this 
# code works in development mode too. So instead of making changes at 2 places I just made changes here.
